##  Implementing Word Dictionary without DB

add_word // adds and updates the word if exist
keep a text file // dictionary.csv
keep an index file // index file dictionary.dat

we merge these 2 files - when we merge we add a header (approach 3)

create a write ahead log before the merge

get_word // note the time taken to get


### Theory

#### Requirements
- Weekly updates to words and meanings.
- Singular lookups.
- Handle 170,000 words with a total size of 1 TB.
- Avoid repetitive entries.
- Maintain storage-compute separation.
- Serve as the foundation for multi-layered storage or a **data lake**.

#### Approach 1: One File per Word
- Store each word in a separate file: `s3://word-dictionary/a/apple.txt`.
- **Issue**: Poor portability and high management overhead.

---

#### Approach 2: Single CSV File with Index
- A single `.csv` file containing all words and meanings.
- A separate index file `.dat` storing the offset of each word for fast lookups.
- **Index File Size**: `171,476 x (average word length + separator + newline) â‰ˆ 2.6 MB`.
- **Lookup**: Use the index file to locate the position of a word in the CSV file for fast retrieval.
- **Updating the Dictionary**
    1. Maintain a **changelog** for updates.
    2. Download the dictionary and merge it with the changelog (sorted merge `O(n)`).
    3. Generate new data and index files, then upload them to S3.
    4. Update metadata (`meta.json`) with version info.

- **Portability Issue**: Managing two files (data and index) can be inconvenient.

---

#### Approach 3: Merge Data and Index in a Single File
- Combine data and index into one file with a fixed-length header.
    - The header stores:
    - Offset of the index and data sections.
    - Metadata such as total words and version.

- **Structure**:
  ```
  [Header (fixed length)][Index Section][Data Section]
  ```

- **Advantages**:
    - Single portable file.
    - Easy lookups using the header for offsets.
