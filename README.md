# Sytem Design Excercises

## Part-1
1. [Implement a simple connection pool using Bounded Blocking Queue](./05-connection-pool/)
2. [Implement Database Sharding and Routing (from API server)](./07-sharding/)
3. [Setup Read-replica from a MySQL locally](./12-mysql-read-replica/)
4. [Implement fair multi-threaded program](./08-multi-thread-program/)
5. [Implement server-sent events](./09-basic-server-sent-events/)
5. [Implement server-sent events using Message Broker](./10-broker-server-sent-event/)
6. Setup [RabbitMQ](./13A-rabbitmq/) and [Kafka](./13B-kafka/) locally
    1. write simple producer and consumer for them
    2. understand how to use them and guarantees they offer
7. Implement real-time chat using socket IO : [https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-chat-platform](Reference)
8. Implement Short Polling and Long Polling
    1. Mock EC2 creation with sleep
    2. Define API that client can do to short poll the status
    3. Define API that client can do to long poll the status
